This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected. 
By examining historical credit card application data, the model will evaluate an individual's creditworthiness and provide effective 
intuitions to financial institutions or users for making updated decisions about credit card approvals. By using the predictive model, 
design and develop a user-friendly interface for end-users to input applicant information and receive credit card approval predictions. 
Then deploy the trained and optimized model in a production environment, allowing real-time credit card approval predictions 
based on new applicant data along with the user interface.
